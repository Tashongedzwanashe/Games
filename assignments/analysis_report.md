# Random Number Generator Performance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of different storage methods for generating random numbers in C++. We compared four storage approaches across three different data sizes and two distribution types, measuring both execution time and memory usage.

## Methodology

### Storage Methods Tested

1. **Static Array**: Fixed-size array allocation (limited to n ≤ 1000)
2. **Dynamic Array**: Using `new[]` and `delete[]`
3. **std::vector**: Standard C++ container
4. **Manual Allocation**: Using `malloc()` and `free()`

### Test Parameters

- **Data Sizes**: n = 1,000, 10,000, 100,000
- **Distributions**:
  - Uniform integers (1-100)
  - Uniform floating-point (0.0-1.0)
- **Metrics**: Execution time (ms) and memory usage (bytes)

## Results and Analysis

### 1. Execution Time Performance

#### Key Findings:

- **std::vector** generally shows the most consistent performance across all sizes
- **Dynamic Array** and **Manual Allocation** show similar performance characteristics
- **Static Array** is fastest for small sizes but limited in applicability
- Integer generation is typically faster than floating-point generation

#### Performance Rankings (Average across all sizes):

1. std::vector
2. Dynamic Array
3. Manual Allocation
4. Static Array (limited applicability)

### 2. Memory Usage Analysis

#### Key Findings:

- All methods show linear memory scaling with data size
- **std::vector** has slightly higher memory overhead due to container management
- **Manual Allocation** and **Dynamic Array** have identical memory usage
- **Static Array** has the lowest memory overhead but limited size range

#### Memory Efficiency (bytes per element):

- Integer: 4 bytes per element
- Float: 8 bytes per element
- std::vector overhead: ~24 bytes per container

### 3. Scalability Analysis

#### Scaling Characteristics:

- **Linear scaling**: Execution time increases linearly with data size
- **Memory scaling**: Perfect linear relationship (n × sizeof(type))
- **std::vector** shows the most predictable scaling behavior
- **Manual allocation** methods show some variability due to memory fragmentation

## Distribution Quality Analysis

### Histogram Analysis

- **Integer Distribution**: Shows uniform distribution across 1-100 range
- **Float Distribution**: Shows uniform distribution across 0.0-1.0 range
- Both distributions pass visual uniformity tests
- No significant bias or clustering observed

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Primary Conclusions:

1. **std::vector is the recommended choice** for most applications due to:

   - Consistent performance across all sizes
   - Automatic memory management
   - Standard C++ container benefits
   - Predictable scaling behavior

2. **Dynamic Array** is suitable when:

   - Maximum performance is required
   - Manual memory management is acceptable
   - Legacy code compatibility is needed

3. **Manual Allocation** should be avoided unless:

   - Interfacing with C libraries
   - Specific memory layout requirements exist

4. **Static Array** is only suitable for:
   - Small, fixed-size datasets
   - Performance-critical small operations
   - Embedded systems with memory constraints

### Performance Recommendations:

- Use **std::vector** for general-purpose applications
- Use **Dynamic Array** for performance-critical applications
- Avoid **Manual Allocation** unless absolutely necessary
- Consider **Static Array** only for small, fixed datasets

### Memory Recommendations:

- All methods show similar memory efficiency
- std::vector overhead is negligible for large datasets
- Consider data type size when choosing between int/float

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Code Quality:

- Template-based implementation for type flexibility
- Proper memory management and cleanup
- High-resolution timing using std::chrono
- CSV export for external analysis

### Limitations:

- Single-threaded performance measurement
- No cache locality analysis
- Limited to uniform distributions
- Platform-specific results may vary

## Future Work

### Potential Extensions:

1. Multi-threaded performance analysis
2. Cache performance measurement
3. Additional distribution types (normal, exponential, etc.)
4. Memory fragmentation analysis
5. Cross-platform performance comparison

### Optimization Opportunities:

1. SIMD vectorization for large datasets
2. Memory pool allocation strategies
3. Compiler optimization analysis
4. Hardware-specific optimizations
