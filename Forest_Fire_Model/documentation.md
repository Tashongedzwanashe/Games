# Forest Fire Model Documentation

## Model Rules

### Cellular Automata Rules

The forest fire simulation implements a cellular automaton with the following state transitions:

1. **Burning Trees (F → .)**: Trees that are currently on fire become empty spaces in the next time step
2. **Fire Spread (T → F)**: Trees catch fire if they have at least one burning neighbor, or due to lightning strikes
3. **Tree Regrowth (. → T)**: Empty spaces can regrow trees with a specified probability

### Neighbor Connectivity

- **8-Neighbor System**: Each cell checks all 8 adjacent cells (including diagonals)
- **Periodic Boundaries**: The grid wraps around at edges, creating a toroidal surface

### Environmental Factors

- **Tree Density**: Initial percentage of cells containing trees
- **Regrowth Rate**: Probability of empty cells growing new trees
- **Lightning Probability**: Chance of trees spontaneously catching fire

## Algorithm Overview

### Initialization Algorithm

```
1. Input grid dimensions (rows, columns)
2. Input tree density (0.0-1.0)
3. Input regrowth and lightning probabilities
4. Initialize empty grid
5. Randomly populate with trees based on density
6. Choose fire start location
7. Set initial burning tree
```

### Main Simulation Loop

```
while simulation_running:
    1. Display current grid state
    2. Show statistics
    3. Process user input
    4. Apply update rules to all cells simultaneously
    5. Update step counter
```

### Cell Update Algorithm

```
for each cell (i,j) in grid:
    if cell == 'F':
        newGrid[i][j] = '.'  // Burn out
    else if cell == 'T':
        if hasBurningNeighbor(i,j) || random() < lightningProb:
            newGrid[i][j] = 'F'  // Catch fire
    else if cell == '.':
        if random() < regrowthProb:
            newGrid[i][j] = 'T'  // Regrow
```

### Neighbor Checking Algorithm

```
hasBurningNeighbor(row, col):
    for each neighbor (di, dj) in 8 directions:
        ni = (row + di + rows) % rows  // Periodic boundary
        nj = (col + dj + cols) % cols
        if grid[ni][nj] == 'F':
            return true
    return false
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Random Number Generation

- **Mersenne Twister (mt19937)**: High-quality random number generator
- **Thread-safe seeding**: Uses random_device for unpredictable seeds
- **Uniform distribution**: For probability-based events

### Memory Management

- **Efficient 2D vectors**: Minimal memory overhead
- **Synchronous updates**: Two-grid system prevents race conditions
- **Automatic cleanup**: RAII principles with destructors

### Performance Optimizations

- **O(n²) complexity**: Linear with grid size
- **Efficient neighbor checking**: Direct array access
- **Minimal allocations**: Reuse of grid objects

## Educational Insights

### What I Learned

1. **Emergent Behavior**: Simple rules create complex, unpredictable patterns
2. **System Dynamics**: Small parameter changes dramatically affect outcomes
3. **Cellular Automata**: Powerful modeling technique for natural phenomena
4. **Interactive Design**: Real-time user control enhances learning experience

### Key Observations

- **Critical Density**: Around 60% tree density creates optimal fire spread
- **Regrowth Balance**: Too high regrowth prevents fire spread, too low creates barren landscapes
- **Lightning Impact**: Small probability creates new fire sources, preventing complete extinction

### Mathematical Concepts Demonstrated

- **Probability Theory**: Stochastic processes in natural systems
- **Graph Theory**: Neighbor connectivity and network effects
- **Dynamical Systems**: State transitions and attractors
- **Complexity Theory**: Emergent behavior from simple rules
