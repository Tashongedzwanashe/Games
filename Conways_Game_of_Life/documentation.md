# Conway's Game of Life - Project Documentation

## 1. Game Description

### Purpose and Rules of Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It simulates a grid-based world where each cell follows simple birth, survival, and death rules to evolve into the next generation.

**Core Rules:**

1. **Survival**: Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives to the next generation
2. **Birth**: Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive
3. **Death**: All other cells die or remain dead (underpopulation or overcrowding)

**Key Features:**

- **Periodic Boundary Conditions**: The grid wraps around at edges, simulating an infinite plane
- **Synchronous Updates**: All cells are updated simultaneously based on their current state
- **Automatic Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when any win condition is achieved

## 2. Algorithm Explanation

### How Generations are Computed

The evolution algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Neighbor Counting**: For each cell, count live neighbors in 8 surrounding positions

   ```cpp
   int countLiveNeighbors(const vector<vector<bool>>& grid, int row, int col, int rows, int cols)
   ```

2. **State Determination**: Apply Conway's rules based on current state and neighbor count

   ```cpp
   if (grid[i][j]) {
       // Live cell: survives with 2-3 neighbors
       nextGrid[i][j] = (neighbors == 2 || neighbors == 3);
   } else {
       // Dead cell: becomes alive with exactly 3 neighbors
       nextGrid[i][j] = (neighbors == 3);
   }
   ```

3. **Synchronous Update**: All cells are updated simultaneously to avoid interference
4. **Boundary Handling**: Periodic boundary conditions using modulo arithmetic

### Automatic Win Condition Detection

The game automatically monitors multiple win conditions simultaneously:

```cpp
struct GameStats {
    map<string, WinCondition> winConditions;

    GameStats() {
        // Initialize all possible win conditions
        winConditions["stability"] = {false, 0, "Stability Goal - Reached a stable configuration"};
        winConditions["survival_10"] = {false, 0, "Survival Goal - Kept cells alive for 10 generations"};
        winConditions["survival_25"] = {false, 0, "Survival Goal - Kept cells alive for 25 generations"};
        winConditions["survival_50"] = {false, 0, "Survival Goal - Kept cells alive for 50 generations"};
        winConditions["survival_100"] = {false, 0, "Survival Goal - Kept cells alive for 100 generations"};
        winConditions["population_balance"] = {false, 0, "Population Target - Maintained balanced population (20-30) for 20 generations"};
        winConditions["glider_pattern"] = {false, 0, "Pattern Creation - Created a glider pattern"};
        winConditions["blinker_pattern"] = {false, 0, "Pattern Creation - Created a blinker pattern"};
        winConditions["block_pattern"] = {false, 0, "Pattern Creation - Created a block pattern"};
        winConditions["time_attack_100"] = {false, 0, "Time Attack - Survived 100+ generations"};
        winConditions["time_attack_500"] = {false, 0, "Time Attack - Survived 500+ generations"};
    }
};
```
